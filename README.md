I am an IT professional, was working with GSFC Ltd.- www.gsfclimited.com  (Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd., Vadodara, Gujarat, India). I worked for GSFC for more than 35 years & retired as IT Head(GSFC University - https://www.gsfcuni.edu.in/). I am associated with IT since era of paper tape, punching card, magnetic tape, floppies etc. were in vouge.

My analytical, logical and curious mind does not allow me to stop working/learnng  with open source community to keep myself in pace with emerging technology like AI, IoT, Blockchain etc..

To satiate my this hunger, i learnt and achieved following certificate from https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/dashboard
